# ProjectD

I completed up to Step 4 of the project, although the 'del' command seemingly stopped working for reasons I can't figure out. The deleteFile function itself, however, works fine. You are able to write to a sector, although it isn't used until the unfinished 'Copy' function. dir works as intended. writeFile also works, as the test code provided does create the new file.
